# GroundZero 🌍

## Where real change begins.

GroundZero is a community-driven issue reporting and volunteering platform designed to empower citizens to identify local problems and take action. From potholes and broken streetlights to waste management and public safety concerns, GroundZero is your starting point for meaningful change in your community.
